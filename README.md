# Teriyaki: A Framework to Generate Neurosymbolic PDDL-compliant Planners

### Read the paper on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00438)

This repo contains the dataset used for the experiments in the paper and a Jupyter notebook with all the steps needed to fine-tune a GPT-3 model into a PDDL solver.

Most blocks shoud be independent from each other and intended to run one by one. Each block is documented with references to the documentation and a basic explanation of the step performed. The paper's results are also included.

**DISCLAIMER:** the project scope has grown significantly since its inception. This repo could use some reformatting and cleanup (i.e., there could be duplicate code, minor inconsistencies regarding the directory tree, etc.). 

We are working on an improved version of the framework as a single application to streamline the process.
